/**
 * Canvas projects and the deployment's Workspace registry.
 *
 * The regression this pins is a grouping one: a canvas is a folder, a card
 * conversation runs with that folder as its cwd, and yet every one of those
 * conversations showed up in the sidebar's 未分组 bucket — the Workspace
 * account, which is the other half of membership, was never claimed. So the
 * plugin now registers the canvas root as a Workspace and accounts its
 * conversations on it.
 *
 * The seam is deliberately forgiving, and the tests below are mostly about
 * that: no registry (a bare harness), a registry that refuses the root, a
 * session it refuses to attach — none of those may reach the wire, because the
 * conversation works either way and grouping is a sidebar nicety.
