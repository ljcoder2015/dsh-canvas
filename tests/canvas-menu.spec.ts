/**
 * The canvas row's actions (F1.5 revision) — the two decisions behind them.
 *
 * The components are view, and the floating layers are the host's own primitives
 * now (placement, Escape, outside-click all live there and are not ours to test).
 * What can still drift silently and break the feature is:
 *
 * - which application id opens the folder (the host filters its catalog by
 *   platform, so a wrong pick here is a button that reports "unknown app"
 *   instead of opening anything), and
 * - which rows the menu carries — and specifically that "open folder" is gone
 *   entirely on a deployment with no file manager, rather than present and
 *   failing when pressed.
 *
 * Both live in modules with no host-primitive imports, which is what lets these
 * run in plain Node: `canvas-menu.tsx` itself pulls in the browser `Menu` /
 * `Modal` (React, react-dom, CSS modules) and is exercised end-to-end instead.
