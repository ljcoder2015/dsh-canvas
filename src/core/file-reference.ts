/**
 * dsh-canvas — the harness's `@file` mention grammar, at the half a board needs
 * (F5.3).
 *
 * A 取材 edge says "this artifact builds on that artifact", and the harness
 * already owns the vocabulary for naming an artifact inside a prompt: an `@`
 * token whose payload is a workspace-relative path, with `@"..."` quoting when
 * the path contains whitespace. Card sessions carry that convention today —
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-file-reference-local` installs its guidance whenever the
 * agent has a `read` tool, which every card session does — so a board that
 * names upstream artifacts in exactly this form needs no new vocabulary, and
 * the model resolves the name with the tool it was already going to use.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does **not** do is carry content. A reference
 * is a pointer: the upstream artifact stays the single file it already is, so
 * it cannot go stale, and nothing enters the conversation until the model
 * decides the material matters and calls `read`. The digest channel is the
 * other half of that trade and lives where it belongs (`ArtifactIo.summarize`).
 *
 * Two properties are copies, not paraphrases:
 *
 * - **Byte-exact output.** `formatFileMention` reproduces the harness's
 *   implementation character for character — the trailing slash a directory
 *   keeps, the quote that stays *open* after that slash (so the host UI can
 *   descend another level), the rejection of paths the grammar cannot carry.
 *   A mention this module mints is one the host's own UI could have minted.
 * - **No dependency on the harness package.** The plugin ships one bundle for
 *   the browser and must load on deployments that never composed the
 *   file-reference packages at all, so the grammar is reproduced here rather
 *   than imported, and it is unit-testable with no container.
 *
 * The completion half of the grammar (`activeAtToken`, which finds the token
 * under a caret) is intentionally absent: a board never autocompletes a path,
 * it formats one.
