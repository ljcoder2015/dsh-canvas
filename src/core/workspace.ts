/**
 * dsh-canvas — the one seam between a canvas project and the deployment's
 * Workspace registry.
 *
 * A canvas *is* a folder, and the harness groups conversations by Workspace:
 * a session is shown under a Workspace only when its id sits on that
 * Workspace's account **and** its stored header `cwd` canonicalizes to exactly
 * the Workspace path. Card conversations already carry the canvas root as
 * their `cwd` — what they never had was the account, so every one of them fell
 * into the sidebar's 未分组 bucket even though the canvas owned the folder they
 * ran in.
 *
 * So, one move, made from two call sites: `claimCanvasWorkspace` registers the
 * canvas root as a Workspace titled after the canvas and accounts the given
 * conversations on it.
 *
 * - Creating a canvas claims it with the sessions its already-seated cards are
 *   bound to, so re-opening an old canvas walks its conversations out of
 *   未分组 on the spot.
 * - Opening a card conversation claims it with that one session, which is how
 *   every conversation opened afterwards lands under its canvas's folder.
 *
 * Registration is idempotent: a folder the user already added to the sidebar
 * by hand resolves to the same record and keeps its own title.
 *
 * All of it is best effort and quiet by design. `ctx.workspaceRegistry` is a
 * deployment service this plugin does not inject (a bare harness has no roster
 * at all, and the service may register after this plugin), so absence means
 * "this deployment has no grouping surface", not "the canvas is broken" — a
 * canvas that cannot be grouped is still a working canvas, and failing its
 * creation over a sidebar nicety would be the worse trade.
