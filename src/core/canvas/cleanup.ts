/**
 * dsh-canvas — which cards a bulk cleanup may take off the board (F1.11).
 *
 * The one thing this module exists to prevent is a bulk operation guessing.
 * `canvas_read_board` shows a card as dimmed whenever the artifact probe does
 * not see a file, and that single fact covers three different situations:
 *
 * - **the file was there and is not any more** — a rename, a delete, a branch
 *   switch. The card is a ghost: its file is gone for good, and clearing it off
 *   the board is the chore this feature exists to shorten.
 * - **the seat exists and its artifact was never written** — a dock spec seats
 *   the card and seeds the file a moment later, a bitmap card stays empty until
 *   a generation run fills it, an Agent may seat a card for what it is about to
 *   write. A seat without an artifact is an *honest* board state (F3.5), not a
 *   missing file, and removing it would throw away the card's conversation
 *   binding and its edges along with it.
 * - **the probe could not answer** — a card id the seam refuses to resolve, a
 *   `stat` the sandbox or the permissions denied. Nothing is known here, so
 *   nothing may be done.
 *
 * Only the first may be swept. The decision is pure — the caller gathers the
 * facts off the disk and the card records and hands them over as plain data —
 * so the rule can be pinned by a test instead of being trusted.
 *
 * Contrast with `removeCard`: taking *one* named card off the board is the
 * user's explicit move and may remove any card, empty seat included.
