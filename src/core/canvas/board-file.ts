/**
 * dsh-canvas — 板面文件（F1.9 / F1.10）。
 *
 * 一张画布原本只活在部署的存储域里（`~/.dsh/storages/dsh_canvas`），于是「画布＝这个
 * 文件夹」这句话只在同一台机器上成立：目录一改名，`projectIdOf(root)` 就换了人，旧记录
 * 成了没人认领的孤儿；换台机器打开同一个目录，只剩一堆按默认网格摆开的卡片。
 *
 * 这个模块补上缺的那一半——**目录自己带一份可迁移的板面投影**，写在
 * `<root>/.dsh-canvas/board.json`：
 *
 * - `id`：这张画布是谁。目录改名、搬家之后，绑定先读它，于是认回同一张画布、同一批
 *   座位与取材（F1.9）。没有它时退回 `projectIdOf(root)`，所以**已经存在的画布一个字节
 *   都不用迁**——第一次重新绑定会照着老身份把文件补出来。
 * - `cards` / `sources` / `notes` / `style` / `name`：人读得懂、可 diff、可手改的板面快照。
 *   换一台机器、或把目录拷给同事，绑定它就能把板面重建出来（F1.10）。
 *
 * 三条不写进去的东西，因为它们不是这张作品的属性：`sessionId`（换台机器就是另一个会话，
 * 带过去只会假装「有对话」）、`viewport`（本机屏幕态）、存储域里的排队意图。布局与关系
 * 跟着作品走，视图状态留在本地——这是这条规则的划线处。
 *
 * **本模块是纯的**：编解码、身份判定与「该补哪些卡片/边/便签」都做成对普通数据的函数，
 * 于是每一条都能在容器外测；读写盘与表都归 `host/board-file.ts`。
