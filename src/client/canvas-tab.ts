/**
 * dsh-canvas — the right pane's tab types (F2.4, §4.7).
 *
 * Two kinds of type are registered here, and the split is the whole design:
 *
 * - **The workbench** is a *page* type: no address patterns, opened by kind.
 *   It is what the right sidebar's guide offers and what a card's "locate"
 *   action brings forward.
 * - **One type per artifact kind** is a *claim* type: it recognizes the
 *   addresses that kind lives at, outranks the built-in viewers, and draws the
 *   card face for the file. Adding a kind is adding an entry to
 *   `core/kind-registry.ts` — the claims here are derived from that same table,
 *   never restated.
 *
 * The claim is deliberately narrow. A type that declares nothing outranks every
 * built-in viewer, so claiming `dsh-resource://file/**` would take the whole
 * product's file opening away from the product. The canvas claims only the
 * patterns its kinds name, and its `canOpen` veto refuses any address that is
 * not inside one of the user's own canvas projects — everything else falls
 * through to the viewers that already handle it.
