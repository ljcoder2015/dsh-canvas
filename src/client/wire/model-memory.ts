/**
 * dsh-canvas — the model a node type remembers.
 *
 * A card's model choice is durable per *session*, which is the host's own rule:
 * `session.selectModel` writes into the session's selection projection. That is
 * right for one artifact and wrong for a canvas, where a user who settles on a
 * model for text nodes expects the next text node to start there instead of
 * re-picking it every time.
 *
 * So the board keeps one small piece of its own memory: the last model the user
 * picked, per node *type*, in the browser. The type key is the kind the card is
 * drawn with (`markdown`, `image`, …), which is what makes "another node like
 * this one" expressible without knowing anything about the file.
 *
 * Three rules keep this honest rather than decorative:
 *
 * - A memory is only ever *offered*. It is written when the user picks from the
 *   composer's own menu, never inferred.
 * - It is only applied to a session the host's projection reports as having no
 *   selection of its own (never run, never picked). A card the user has already
 *   used is never silently re-pointed at another model.
 * - A remembered model that the current catalog no longer offers is ignored, so
 *   memory cannot resurface an id the deployment has dropped.
