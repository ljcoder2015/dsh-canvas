/**
 * dsh-canvas — the live list of canvas projects.
 *
 * Canvas projects are only ever created by this plugin's own interface, so the
 * list needs no polling: one read at startup, and a forced re-read after every
 * create (and after a canvas panel is about to be selected, since the panel it
 * addresses may have just come into being).
 *
 * Two consumers share it, and they want different things from it:
 *
 * - the main column mounts and recycles one panel per canvas (the `sync`
 *   listener in canvas-panels.tsx), and
 * - the sidebar's canvas area renders the list (a `useSyncExternalStore`
 *   subscriber in canvas-nav.tsx), which compares snapshots **by reference**.
 *
 * That second consumer is why `snapshot()` exists and why every notification
 * carries one array: a fresh array per read would read as a change on every
 * render pass.
