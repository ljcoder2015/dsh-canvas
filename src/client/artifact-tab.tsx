/**
 * dsh-canvas — the per-kind tab an artifact opens in (F2.4, §4.7).
 *
 * This is the client half of the kind registry. The host decides *what* an
 * artifact is from its evidence; this half claims the *addresses* of the kinds
 * the canvas has a face for and, once claimed, shows that face: the digest,
 * the material chain, the queued intents, and the way back to the board.
 *
 * The tab also carries the one action the board cannot: pulling a file that
 * lives inside a project root onto the canvas. That is `card.createCard`, and
 * the seat it lands on is computed by the same pure `nextFreeSeat` the host
 * uses, so a card added from here and a card added from a scan agree.
