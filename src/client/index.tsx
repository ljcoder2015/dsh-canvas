/**
 * dsh-canvas — Client plugin entry (browser half).
 *
 * The boot order here is not incidental; it is the whole file:
 *
 * 1. The stylesheet and the dictionaries go first, because every seat
 *    registered below renders copy and needs its classes to exist.
 * 2. The seats are registered **synchronously**, before the Remote mount
 *    resolves. A registration that waited on an `await` could miss its seat's
 *    declaration and silently never render, so the bridge is created empty and
 *    attached to once the namespaces arrive — a call made in the gap reports
 *    that plainly instead of throwing a property error.
 * 3. Only then is the Remote mounted, and the last thing is the wiring that
 *    needs the mounted faces.
 *
 * Everything runs through `ctx.effect`, so unloading the plugin takes the
 * dictionaries, the tab types, the seats and the in-flight calls with it and
 * leaves the product exactly as it was.
